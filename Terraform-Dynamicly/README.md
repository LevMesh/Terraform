Hey There! My name is Lev Meshorer

In order to make the project work in your pc you need to enter to variables.tf file and change the variables according to your region/preferences ***AND*** in order to stash your tf.state file in your own backend (s3) you will need to change the backend section in the main.tf file.


After you've done that you can hit the command: 'terraform apply' and enjoy the script :)
